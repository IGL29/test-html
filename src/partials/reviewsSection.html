          I love the diversity of food - cooked in small batches by fantastic, local chefs and then delivered! The food
          is very different to traditional takeaways and always feels freshly cooked with pride and love.

          Itâ€™s great being the opportunity to try food that I would likely not encounter unless I was abroad! Many dishes take me back to my childhood memories - and I love supporting local chefs
